/* 
converting functional to pseudoclassical

methods need ot be outside constructor body
methods stored on the class' prototype
no explicit return statement
no explicit instance of object
change references to the instance to "this"
added argument to pass in timeBetweenSteps in .step method
delegating subclass (blinkyDancer) prototype to refer to the super class (Dancer)
